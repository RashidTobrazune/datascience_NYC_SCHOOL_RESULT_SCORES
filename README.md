# datascience_NYC_SCHOOL_RESULT_SCORES
I explored the New York Public Schools Test Result Scores
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

I was provided with a dataset called schools.csv, which is previewed below.

I have been tasked with answering three(3) key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.
1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?
   -The best math results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score of 800.
3. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
4. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT scores?

   'Stuyvesant High School ' had the best average math result followed by ' bronx high school of science '. CHECK OUT MY CODE AND RUN IT.
